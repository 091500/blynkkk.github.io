#Sharing

## Dashboard sharing with Auth Token
In case you want to give access of your project to your family, friends or customers you may use Blynk feature 
called "Dashboard sharing". In order to use it, go to Dashboard settings and enable sharing :

It will generate QR code you could share with anyone you want :

That's it! Now person you shared project with should scan it from login screen (scanning from existing profile is not yet supported) ;

## Dashboard sharing without Auth Token
In case you want to share your dashboard without Auth token and thus without access to your device 
(for example it could be ideal case for instructable) in project setting go to **Generate Link** button.
