#Roadmap

We build Blynk based on Blynkers feedback but with limited resources we have to prioritize our features. At the moment list look like that:

- Public profile sharing (project sharing with Auth Token so any user can control your hardware);
- BLE support;
- Hardware state handling (changing physical button state changes Blynk application state);
- Hardware online/offlane state improvements (better indication for "is hardware online?", "is hardware offline?");
- RTC widget;
- Customization for widgets (button with icons, color changes, etc);
- Phone sensors widgets (GPS, accelerometer);
- IP camera support;
- Home screen widget (to avoid opening App when you need only 1 button click);
- Haptic feedback (vibration) when touching widgets
- Visual cleanup (more streamlined and consistent design)
