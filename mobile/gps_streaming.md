### GPS Streaming

Useful for monitoring smartphone location data such as latitude, longitude, altitude and speed (speed could be often 0  
in case smartphone doesn't support it).

In order to accept data from this widget you need to : 

```cpp
BLYNK_WRITE(V1) {
  float latitude = param[0].asFloat(); 
  float longitude = param[1].asFloat();
  float altitude = param[2].asFloat();
  float speed = param[3].asFloat();
}
```

GPS Streaming works in background.
