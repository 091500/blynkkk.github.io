### Device Selector

Device selector very powerful widget that allows you to utilize your project space and use it more 
effectively with multiple devices. 

Imagine you have 4 different devices that do the same job, let's say - 4 devices with DHT sensors. Right now in order 
to see temperature in app you have to add 4 value displays and assign every display to specific device. That's fine.
But what if you want also to display humidity? You have to add 4 more displays... And you need 8 widgets in total.
Now, with Device Selector - you no longer need this. All you have to do - add Device Selector widget to project, 
create 1 value display for temperature and 1 value display for humidity and assign them to Device Selector during editing.  
Run project. Now you can select any device in Device Selector widget and your widgets will show info 
for device currently selected in Device Selector. You can change device in realtime and widgets will get latest values 
from server.
