#Blynk main operations

##Virtual Pins
Blynk can control Digital and Analog I/O Pins on you hardware directly. You don't even need to write code for it. 
It's great for blinking LEDs, but often it's just not enough...

We designed Virtual Pins to send **any** data from your microcontroller to the Blynk App and back. 

Anything you connect to your hardware will be able to talk to Blynk.
With Virtual Pins you can send something from the App, process it on microcontroller and then send it back to the smartphone. You can trigger functions, read I2C devices, convert values, control servo and DC motors etc.

Virtual Pins can be used to interface with external libraries (Servo, LCD and others) and implement custom functionality. 

Hardware may send data to the Widgets over the Virtual Pin like this:

```cpp
Blynk.virtualWrite(pin, "abc");
Blynk.virtualWrite(pin, 123);
Blynk.virtualWrite(pin, 12.34);
Blynk.virtualWrite(pin, "hello", 123, 12.34);
```

For more information about virtual pins, [read this](http://docs.blynk.cc/#blynk-firmware-virtual-pins-control)

##Send data from app to hardware
You can send any data from Widgets in the app to your hardware.

All [Controller Widgets](http://docs.blynk.cc/#widgets-controllers) can send data to Virtual Pins on your hardware. 
For example, code below shows how to get values from the Button Widget in the App

```cpp
BLYNK_WRITE(V1) //Button Widget is writing to pin V1
{
  int pinData = param.asInt(); 
}
```
When you press a Button, Blynk App sends ```1``` On the second click - it sends ```0``` 

This is how Button Widget is set up:

###Sending array from Widget 
Some Widgets (e.g Joystick, zeRGBa) have more than one output. 

<img src="images/joystick_merge_mode.png" style="width: 200px; height:360px"/>

This output can be written to Virtual Pin as an array of values. 
On the hardware side - you can get any element of the array [0,1,2...] by using: 

```cpp
BLYNK_WRITE(V1) // Widget WRITEs to Virtual Pin V1
{   
  int x = param[0].asInt(); // getting first value
  int y = param[1].asInt(); // getting second value
  int z = param[N].asInt(); // getting N value
}
```

##Get data from hardware
There are two ways of pushing data from your hardware to the Widgets in the app over Virtual Pins.

###Perform requests by Widget
- Using Blynk built-in reading frequency while App is active by setting 'Reading Frequency' parameter to some interval:

<img src="images/frequency_reading_pull.png" style="width: 200px; height:360px"/>

```cpp
BLYNK_READ(V5) // Widget in the app READs Virtal Pin V5 with the certain frequency
{
  // This command writes Arduino's uptime in seconds to Virtual Pin V5
  Blynk.virtualWrite(5, millis() / 1000);
}
```

**Sketch:** [PushDataOnRequest](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/blob/master/examples/GettingStarted/PushDataOnRequest/PushDataOnRequest.ino#L26)


###Pushing data from hardware
If you need to PUSH sensor or other data from your hardware to Widget, you can write any logic you want. 
Just set the frequency to PUSH mode. Any command that hardware sends to Blynk Cloud is automatically stored on server
and you get this info either with [History Graph](http://docs.blynk.cc/#widgets-displays-history-graph) widget 
or with [HTTP API](http://docs.blynkapi.apiary.io/#reference/0/pin-history-data/get-all-history-data-for-specific-pin).

<img src="images/frequency_reading_push.png" style="width: 200px; height:360px"/>

We recommend sending data in intervals and avoiding [Flood Error](http://docs.blynk.cc/#troubleshooting-flood-error).
For example, this [SimpleTimer Library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/SimpleTimer) is an Arduino library for timed events. 
Please read instructions inside this [example sketch](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/blob/master/examples/GettingStarted/PushData/PushData.ino#L30) for more details.

SimpleTimer is included in Blynk's library. Here is how it can work:

```cpp
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Ethernet.h>
#include <BlynkSimpleEthernet.h>
#include <SimpleTimer.h> // here is the SimpleTimer library

char auth[] = "YourAuthToken"; // Put your token here

SimpleTimer timer; // Create a Timer object called "timer"! 

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Blynk.begin(auth);
  
  timer.setInterval(1000L, sendUptime); //  Here you set interval (1sec) and which function to call 
}

void sendUptime()
{
  // This function sends Arduino up time every 1 second to Virtual Pin (V5)
  // In the app, Widget's reading frequency should be set to PUSH
  // You can send anything with any interval using this construction
  // Don't send more that 10 values per second
  
  Blynk.virtualWrite(V5, millis() / 1000);
}

void loop()
{
  Blynk.run(); // all the Blynk magic happens here
  timer.run(); // SimpleTimer is working
}
```

##State syncing

###For hardware
If your hardware looses Internet connection or resets, you can restore all the values from Widgets in the Blynk app.

```cpp
BLYNK_CONNECTED() {
  if (isFirstConnect) {
    Blynk.syncAll();
  }
}
```

The ```Blynk.syncAll()``` command restores all the Widgets' values based on the last saved values on the server. All analog and digital pin states will be restored. Every Virtual Pin will perform BLYNK_WRITE event.

[Full Sketch](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/blob/master/examples/More/Sync/Sync.ino)

You can also update a single Virtual Pin value by calling ```Blynk.syncVirtual(pin)```

###For app
If you need to keep your hardware in sync with Widgets' state even if app is offline use ```Blynk.virtualWrite```.

Imagine you have a LED Widget connected to the Virtual Pin V1 in the app, and a physical button attached to your hardware. When you press a physical button, you would expect to see updated state of the LED Widget in the app. To achieve that you need to send ```Blynk.virtualWrite(V1, HIGH)``` when a physical button gets pressed.

[Represent physical button state via LED widget with polling](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/blob/master/examples/More/ButtonPoll/ButtonPoll.ino)

## Change widget property
Latest Blynk library also supports ability to change widget property from hardware side (implemented for Android only). 
You can for instance change color of LED widget when necessary. For example :

```
//change color
Blynk.setProperty(V0, "color", "#D3435C");

//change label
Blynk.setProperty(V0, "label", "My New Widget Label");
```

[Full Sketch](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/blob/master/examples/More/SetPropery/SetPropery.ino#L34)

For now 2 widget properties supported - ```color``` and ```label``` and only for widgets assigned to Virtual pins.

```label``` is string for label.

```color``` is string in [HEX](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp) format (in the form: #RRGGBB, 
where RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and FF). 

For example : 

``` 
#define BLYNK_GREEN     "#23C48E"
#define BLYNK_BLUE      "#04C0F8"
#define BLYNK_YELLOW    "#ED9D00"
#define BLYNK_RED       "#D3435C"
#define BLYNK_DARK_BLUE "#5F7CD8"
``` 

##Limitations and Recommendations
- Don't put ```Blynk.virtualWrite``` and any other ```Blynk.*``` command inside ```void loop()```- it will cause 
lot's of outgoing messages to our server and your connection will be terminated; 

- We recommend calling functions with intervals. For example, this 
[SimpleTimer Library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/SimpleTimer) is a simple library for timed events. 
Please read instructions inside this [example sketch](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/blob/master/examples/GettingStarted/PushData/PushData.ino#L30) for more details;

- Avoid using long delays with ```delay()``` â€“ it may cause connection breaks;

- If you send more than 100 values per second - you may cause 
[Flood Error](http://docs.blynk.cc/#troubleshooting-flood-error) and your hardware will be automatically disconnected from the server;

- Be careful sending a lot of ```Blynk.virtualWrite``` commands as most hardware is not very powerful (like ESP8266) 
so it may not handle many requests.
