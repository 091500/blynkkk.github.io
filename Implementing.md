# Implementing a Blynk HW client (library)
Currently we provide Arduino/C++ implementation of the library.
It is very extensible and modular, look at [the list of supported hardware](http://blynkkk.github.io/#list-of-supported-hardware).
Adding new connection types and Arduino-compatible boards is easy.

TODO: Porting guide.

But some devices are programmed in other languages, like:

* Espruino, JavaScript, Node.JS
* MicroPython, Python
* NodeMCU, eLua

This document hints how to write a custom library.

## Blynk library main functions

* Provide easy-to use API
 * Virtual pin handlers registration
 * Provide comfortable wrappers for some widgets
* Manage connection
 * Should support different connection type/hardware, if applicable
* Serialize/deserialize Blynk protocol
* Handle direct pin operations
* Should be portable across similar devices (or same technology/programming language), if possible
* Should detect and notify the user about [troubles](http://blynkkk.github.io/#troubleshooting) where possible (especially Flood)

### Adding new HW board

Different boards can be added by creating JSON board description file.

```json
{
    "name": "Arduino UNO",
    "map": {
        "digital": {
            "pins": {
                "D0":  0,  "D1":  1,  "D2":  2,  "D3":  3, "D4": 4,
                "D5":  5,  "D6":  6,  "D7":  7,  "D8":  8, "D9": 9,
                "D10": 10, "D11": 11, "D12": 12, "D13": 13
            },
            "ops": [ "dr", "dw" ]
        },
        "analog": {
            "pins": {
                "A0": 14, "A1": 15, "A2": 16, "A3": 17, "A4": 18, "A5": 19
            },
            "ops": [ "dr", "dw", "ar" ],
            "arRange":[0, 1023]
        },
        "pwm": {
            "pins": [
                "D3", "D5", "D6", "D9", "D10", "D11"
            ],
            "ops": [ "aw" ],
            "awRange":[0, 255]
        },
        "virtual":  {
            "pinsRange": [ 0, 31 ],
            "ops": [ "vr", "vw" ]
        }
    }
}
```

Look at the [full boards list](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/tree/master/boards_json).
You can send us your own board description file for review and App integration.

There may be a problem that you want to start testing your implementation, but your board is not listed int the Blynk App.
On Android, we now have a "Generic Board" specially for such purposes.
Unfortunately iOS does not have it yet.

Basically you can select UNO board and check how it works using just virtual pins.
Most digital pins will also work.
Analog IO/PWM will not work in general, until we add your board to the App.

## Blynk protocol

Blynk transfers binary messages with the following structure:

| Command       | Message Id    | Length/Status   | Body     |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|:--------:|
| 1 byte        | 2 bytes       | 2 bytes         | Variable |

Message Id and Length are [big endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Big-endian).
Body has a command-specific format.

Command and Status definitions: [BlynkProtocolDefs.h](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/blob/master/Blynk/BlynkProtocolDefs.h)

Another protocol description can be found [here](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server/blob/master/README_FOR_APP_DEVS.md#protocol-messages).

Typical Blynk library knows how to send(S)/process(P):

    S   BLYNK_CMD_LOGIN + auth token
    SP  BLYNK_CMD_PING
    SP  BLYNK_CMD_RESPONSE
    SP  BLYNK_CMD_BRIDGE
    SP  BLYNK_CMD_HARDWARE
    S   BLYNK_CMD_TWEET
    S   BLYNK_CMD_EMAIL
    S   BLYNK_CMD_PUSH_NOTIFICATION

## HARDWARE/BRIDGE command body

The body of these commands are encoded as a sequence of strings, separated by ```'\0'``` ([Null character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character)).
Please note that the last value may be not Null-terminated.
In the following command examples ```\0``` chars are replaced with spaces.

### Pin mode

PinMode command is received by library after connection, or when a mobile application starts.

    pm <pin> <mode>
    pm <pin> <mode> <pin> <mode> <pin> <mode> ...

Mode:

* in - INPUT
* out - OUTPUT
* pu - INPUT_PULLUP
* pd - INPUT_PULLDOWN

### Digital pin operations

Digital write:

    dw <pin> <val>

Digital read:

    dr <pin>

### Analog pin operations

    aw <pin> <val>

    ar <pin>

### Virtual pin operations

    vw <pin> <param0> <param1> <param2> <param3> ...

    vr <pin>

### Other operations

    info

TODO

## Developer notes

* Values in HW commands are plain text.
* In response to ```dr/ar``` command, library should send ```dw/aw``` command on the same pin and with the same message id.
* These situations should cause a connection drop, or reconnection attempt:
 * Message with ```ID=0``` is received
 * Message with unknown type is received
 
## Adding network interface 
4 entities should be created to add a new network interface to Blynk:
 
1. Select connection interface that will be used for Blynk operation.  
   This should be something like http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/WebClient  
   Based on the API of the connection, create the **Transport**.  
   Some examples may be found in the Adapters folder:
   * BlynkTransportSerial
   * BlynkTransportCC3000
   * BlynkArduinoClient - *can be reused, if possible*
   
2. Create **Blynk representative class**, which contains connection-specific helper functions (like begin).
   Examples:
   * BlynkEthernet
   * BlynkSerial
   * BlynkCC3000
   * BlynkWildFire
   * BlynkYun
   
3. Create **BlynkSimple*** header for your connection.  
   This constructs main **Blynk instance**, so the user (mostly) doesn't need to get into such details.  
   Examples:
   * BlynkSimpleEthernet.h
   * BlynkSimpleCC3000.h
   * BlynkSimpleWifi.h
   * BlynkSimpleUIPEthernet.h
   
4. Create a **simple example** for your platform ;)
