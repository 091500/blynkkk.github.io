#What is Blynk?
Imagine a prototyping board on your smartphone where you drag and drop buttons, sliders, displays, graphs and other functional widgets. And in a matter of minutes these widgets can control Arduino and get data from it.

Blynk is not an app that works only with a particular shield. Instead, it's been designed to support the boards and shields you are already using. And it works on iOs and Android.

Blynk also works over USB. This means you can tinker with the app by connecting it to your laptop or desktop while waiting for some internet shield to arrive.
