#Blynk Basics

You can find [example sketches](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/tree/master/examples) covering basic Blynk Features. 
They are included in the library. All the sketches are designed to be easily combined with each other.
 
##How does it work?
**Blynk works over the Internet.** So the one and only requirement is that your hardware can talk to the Internet.

No matter what type of connection you choose - Ethernet, Wi-Fi or maybe this new ESP8266 everyone is talking about â€“ 
Blynk libraries and example sketches will get you online, connect to Blynk Server and pair up with your smartphone.

It's not that easy to take Arduino out of your home network, so we've built a [Blynk server](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server). 
It handles all the authentication and communication, and also keeps an eye on your board while the smartphone is offline. 
Blynk server runs on Java and is open-source. You will be able to [run it locally](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server#blynk-server) if you really need to. 
Messaging between mobile apps , Blynk Server and Arduino is based on a simple, lightweight and fast binary protocol over TCP/IP sockets.

###Sending data to hardware
All [Controller Widgets](http://docs.blynk.cc/#widgets-controllers) can send data to Virtual Pins on your hardware. 
For instance, below code shows how to retrieve 1 and 0 int value on hardware via pressing button on virtual pin 1 
within Application:
```cpp
BLYNK_WRITE(1)
{
  int pinData = param.asInt(); 
}
```

and this widget setup:

In above example when you press button you'll get 1 and on second click 0 within pinData variable.

###Sending data array to hardware 
Some Widgets (e.g Joystick, zeRGBa) have more than one output. 

<img src="images/joystick_merge_mode.png" style="width: 300px;"/>

This output is an array of values. You can get any parameter of the array [0,1,2...] by using: 

```cpp
BLYNK_WRITE(pinNumber)
{   
  int x = param[0].asInt();
  int y = param[1].asInt();
}
```

###Sending data to smartphone

There are two ways of pushing data from your hardware to the Widgets in the app over Virtual Pins :

- Using Blynk built-in reading frequency while app active by setting Reading Frequency parameter to required interval:

<img src="images/frequency_reading_pull.png" style="width: 300px;"/>

```cpp
// This function tells Arduino what to do if there is a Widget
// which is requesting data for Virtual Pin (5)
BLYNK_READ(5)
{
  // This command writes Arduino's uptime in seconds to Virtual Pin (5)
  Blynk.virtualWrite(5, millis() / 1000);
}
```

**Sketch:** [PushDataOnRequest](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library/blob/master/examples/GettingStarted/PushDataOnRequest/PushDataOnRequest.ino#L26)

- Writing your own logic of pushing data at any time by setting Reading Frequency parameter to PUSH:

<img src="images/frequency_reading_push.png" style="width: 300px;"/>

```cpp
void sendUptime()
{
  // You can send any value at any time.
  // Please don't send more that 10 values per second.
  Blynk.virtualWrite(5, millis() / 1000);
}
```
